# Changelog for ReStructure

This file documents notable changes to the ReStructure project.

The format of this file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

In short this means that version numbers, visible here and on the login page of the app match, and have a predictable format indicating how much change from the previous version has occurred.

The [Unreleased](#unreleased) section collects notes for unreleased changes and features, until they are absorbed into a formal release in a version number tagged section below.

Note that not every tagged version may be suitable for production use. A Github release will be created for any release tested in production, and may be marked below with the tag [Release].

Since [version 8.4.0](#840---2024-01-10) the convention is that releases made within forked repositories should be up-versioned with a patch release, *x.y.z+1*. When changes are incorporated back into the primary repo [consected/restructure](https://github.com/consected/restructure) a new minor release will be created, *x.y+1,0*.
